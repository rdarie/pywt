PyWavelets 1.4.0 Release Notes
==============================

.. contents::

We are very pleased to announce the release of PyWavelets 1.4. This release
is a minor update to 1.3.0. It adds wheels for Python 3.11 and drops support
for Python 3.7.

There is one new utility function, `pywt.frequency2scale`, that can be used to
determine CWT scale factors corresponding to a given (normalized) frequency.
It is the inverse of the existing `pywt.scale2frequency`.

A detailed change log is provided below.
