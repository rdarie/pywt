PyWavelets 1.2.0 Release Notes
==============================

.. contents::

We are very pleased to announce the release of PyWavelets 1.2.

PyWavelets now requires Python 3.7+.


New features
============


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

- The image returned by ``pywt.data.camera`` has been replaced by a similar,
  CC0-licensed image because the original image was determined to only be
  licensed for non-commercial use. Any users who still need the prior camera
  image for non-commercial use can find it many places online by performing a
  web search for "cameraman test image".

Bugs Fixed
==========


Other changes
=============

- PyWavelets has dropped support for Python 3.5 and 3.6 in this release.
