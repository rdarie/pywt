==============================
PyWavelets 0.5.2 Release Notes
==============================

PyWavelets 0.5.2 is a bug-fix release with no new features compared to 0.5.1.


Bugs Fixed
==========

The ``pywt.data.nino`` data reader is now compatible with numpy 1.12. (#273)

The ``wp_scalogram.py`` demo is now compatible with matplotlib 2.0. (#276)

Fixed a sporadic segmentation fault affecting stationary wavelet transforms of
multi-dimensional data. (#289)

``idwtn`` now treats coefficients set to None to be treated as zeros (#291).
This makes the behavior consistent with its docstring as well as idwt2.
Previously this raised an error.

The tests are now included when installing from wheels or when running
``python setup.py install``. (#292)

A bug leading to a potential ``RuntimeError`` was fixed in ``waverec``.
This bug only affected transforms where the data was >1D and the transformed
axis was not the first axis of the array. (#294).
