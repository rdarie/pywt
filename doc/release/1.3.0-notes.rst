PyWavelets 1.3.0 Release Notes
==============================

.. contents::

We are very pleased to announce the release of PyWavelets 1.3. This release
is functionally the same as 1.2.0, but we have updated the set of binary wheels
provided. Specifically we have added `aarch64` wheels for Python 3.7 that were
missing in 1.2.0 and have updated the versions of `manylinux` used for the
linux wheels in a manner consistent with NumPy and SciPy. We have also dropped
`musllinux` wheels which were present for some architectures in 1.2.0. We may
add them again in the future if they are adopted by NumPy and there is a
demand for this architecture.
