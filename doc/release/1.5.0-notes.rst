PyWavelets 1.5.0 Release Notes
==============================

.. contents::

We are very pleased to announce the release of PyWavelets 1.5.0. This release
is a minor update to 1.4.x. It adds support for Python 3.12 and drops support
for Python 3.8. It also adds support for Cython 3.0.

PyWavelets now uses Meson as its build system, and meson-python
as the build backend. This requires no changes from users, a
``pip install pywavelets`` will now use ``meson-python`` under
the hood.
